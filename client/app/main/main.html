        Welcome to Telebum! The app that keeps track of all the tv shows you watch. Login or create a new account and hit the plus button in the top right corner to add your tv shows. Telebum is meant to be used quickly and efficiently, simply open the page, tap plus to advance an episode you have seen, and then leave it. More detailed views are available by clicking the show name.

        This is just an early alpha version of Telebum, I have big plans for the future of this app, this includes facebook friends, a watch later and completed list, and show watching groups.
